1. type javac Dijkstra.java to compile.
2. type java Dijkstra to run the program.

The program starts by asking the user to provide the 3 informations:
	- Number of nodes in the graph.
	- A sequence of edges with edge's weight.
		- The format of an edge should be: Node_A, length, Node_B.
			- Node_A and Node_B can be any combination of characters and number.
			- length should be either an integer or a floating number.
		- The graph is being made by linking nodes by edges
		- The user can terminate this phase by entering -1 to stop entering edges.
	- The source and destination
